**[Show priority selection]**

**Narrator:** "Next, we'll set the priority. TaskFlow Pro offers three levels: Low, Medium, and High priority. Each has its own color coding - green for low, yellow for medium, and red for high priority. Let's make this high priority since it's important."

## SMART FILTERING SYSTEM (4:30 - 5:30)

**Narrator:** "TaskFlow Pro's intelligent filtering system helps you focus on what matters most. We have five smart filters, each with live counters."

## TIME-BASED FEATURES & OVERDUE DETECTION (5:30 - 6:30)

**[Create overdue task]**

**Narrator:** "I'll create a task called 'Submit monthly report' and set it for yesterday. Watch what happens when I save it."

**[Show overdue indicators]**

**Narrator:** "Immediately, TaskFlow Pro recognizes this as overdue. The task gets a red border, an 'Overdue' badge with a warning icon, and the due date text turns red. The system continuously monitors your tasks and updates their status automatically."

**[Point to overdue warnings]**

**Narrator:** "If you have overdue tasks, the system prominently displays a warning with the count, ensuring you stay aware of urgent items that need attention."

---

## SORTING & ORGANIZATION (7:30 - 8:00)

**[Screen: Show multiple tasks with different priorities and due dates]**

**Narrator:** "TaskFlow Pro automatically sorts your tasks intelligently. Completed tasks move to the bottom, overdue tasks rise to the top with red highlighting, then tasks are sorted by priority level, and finally by due date."
